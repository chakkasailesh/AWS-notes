6R's of Migration:
1.Rehosting
->lift-and-shift
->move your applications from your source environment to the AWS Cloud without making any changes to the application
2.Replatforming
->lift, tinker, and shift or lift and reshape. Similar to a lift and shift strategy. 
->The difference is that you will make some more changes and adjustments to applications so they are optimized and will work 
better and faster when hosted on the cloud
3.Repurchasing
->drop and shop
->the strategy where the legacy application is fully replaced by a SaaS-solution that provides the same or similar capabilities
4.Refactoring/Re-architecting
->move an application to the cloud and modify its architecture by taking full advantage of cloud-native features to improve agility, performance, and scalability
5.Retire
->Some of your applications and services might not be useful anymore. 
->Thereâ€™s no reason to migrate them to the cloud if they are not going to be of value to your customers
6.Retain
->migration strategy for applications that you want to keep in your source environment or applications that you are not ready to migrate. 
-> might choose to migrate these applications in the future

AWS Migration Hub:
->provides a single location to track migration tasks across multiple AWS tools and partner solutions
->provides key metrics and progress information for individual applications, regardless of which tools are used to migrate them

AWS Application Discovery Service:
->helps you plan cloud migration projects by gathering information about your on-premises data centers
->integrated with AWS Migration hub
->gathered information can be analyzed using Amazon Athena and Amazon QuickSight

AWS Database Migration Service:
->migration and replication service that helps move your database and analytics workloads to AWS quickly, securely, and with minimal downtime and zero data loss
->migrate data from your database that is on-premises, on an Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) DB instance, or in a database on an 
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance to a database on an AWS service. These services can include a database on Amazon RDS or a database 
on an Amazon EC2 instance. 
->You can also migrate a database from an AWS service to an on-premises database. 
->You can migrate between source and target endpoints that use the same database engine(from an Oracle database to an Oracle database)homogeneous
->You can also migrate between source and target endpoints that use different database engines(from an Oracle database to a PostgreSQL database)heterogeneous

AWS Server Migration Service:
->Migrate your on-premises workloads to AWS
AWS Application Migration Service:
->highly automated lift-and-shift solution that simplifies and expedites migration to AWS.
->minimizes time-intensive, error-prone manual processes by automating the conversion of your source servers to run natively on AWS.

AWS Snow Family: 
->service that helps to run operations in austere, non-data center environments, and in locations where there's no consistent network connectivity. 
->You can use these devices to locally and cost-effectively access the storage and compute power of the AWS Cloud in places where an internet 
connection might not be an option
->Snowcone: Weighs 4.5 pounds, 8TB capacity. Portable, rugged, and secure
->Snowball: Petabyte-scale. Edge computing, data migration, and edge storage device. Encrypted. Upto 100TB storage 
->Snowmobile: Exabyte-scale. 45-foot long ruggedized shipping container. Secure, encrypted. Upto 100PB storage

AWS Transfer Family:
->secure transfer service that stores your data in Amazon Simple Storage Service or Amazon Elastic File System and simplifies the migration of 
Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP), File Transfer Protocol Secure (FTPS), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and Applicability Statement 2 (AS2) workflows to AWS

AWS DataSync:
->data-transfer service that simplifies, automates, and accelerates moving and replicating data between on-premises storage systems and AWS storage services
