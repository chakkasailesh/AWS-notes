S3(Simple Storage Service):
->Amazon S3 is an object storage service that stores data as objects within buckets. 
->An object is a file and any metadata that describes the file. A bucket is a container for objects. Bucket name is globally unique
->Storage service to all kinds of data

Storage classes:
Amazon S3 offers a range of storage classes designed for different use cases
• Standard -> The default storage class
• Standard-IA -> Amazon S3 stores the object data redundantly across multiple geographically separated Availability Zones
• One Zone-IA -> Amazon S3 stores the object data in only one Availability Zone, which makes it less expensive than S3 Standard-IA
• Intelligent Tiering -> Amazon S3 storage class that's designed to optimize storage costs by automatically moving data to the 
most cost-effective access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead
• Glacier -> Use for archiving data that is rarely accessed and requires milliseconds retrieval
• Glacier Deep Archive -> Use for archiving data that rarely needs to be accessed. Default retrieval time of 12 hours

Storage management:
Amazon S3 has storage management features that you can use to manage costs, meet regulatory requirements, 
reduce latency, and save multiple distinct copies of your data for compliance requirements.
• S3 Lifecycle – Configure a lifecycle configuration to manage your objects and store them cost effectively throughout their lifecycle. 
You can transition objects to other S3 storage classes or expire objects that reach the end of their lifetimes.
• S3 Object Lock – Prevent Amazon S3 objects from being deleted or overwritten for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely. You can use Object Lock to help meet 
regulatory requirements that require write-once-read-many (WORM) storage or to simply add another layer of protection against object changes and deletions.
• S3 Replication – Replicate objects and their respective metadata and object tags to one or more destination buckets in the same or 
different AWS Regions for reduced latency, compliance, security, and other use cases.
• S3 Batch Operations – Manage billions of objects at scale with a single S3 API request or a few clicks in the Amazon S3 console. 
You can use Batch Operations to perform operations such as Copy, Invoke AWS Lambda function, and Restore on millions or billions of objects.

Bucket policy:
->A bucket policy is a resource-based AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy that you can use to grant access permissions to your bucket 
and the objects in it. Only the bucket owner can associate a policy with a bucket
->Common elements – Resources, Actions, Effect, Principal

EFS(Amazon Elastic File System):
->provides serverless, fully elastic file storage so that you can share file data without provisioning or managing storage capacity and performance
->Multiple compute instances, including Amazon EC2, Amazon ECS, and AWS Lambda, can access an Amazon EFS file system at the same time

EFS Storage classes:
->Standard storage classes – EFS Standard and EFS Standard–Infrequent Access (Standard–IA), which offer Multi-AZ resilience 
and the highest levels of durability and availability.
->One Zone storage classes – EFS One Zone and EFS One Zone–Infrequent Access (EFS One Zone–IA), which offer you the choice of 
additional savings by choosing to save your data in a single Availability Zone.

FSx:
Highly-performant, Fully managed, and Reliable file system
• Windows File Server:Fully managed, highly reliable, and scalable file storage. Accessible over SMB protocol. Built on Windows Server
• Lustre:Fully managed, cost-effective, high-performance storage
• NetApp
• ONTAP
• OpenZFS

EBS volume:
->durable, block-level storage device. After you attach a volume to an instance, you can use it as you would use a physical hard drive
->You can use EBS volumes as primary storage for data that requires frequent updates, such as the system drive for an instance or storage for a database application
->Attached only to one instance at a time. Volumes can be backed-up as snapshots
->You can attach multiple EBS volumes to a single instance. The volume and instance must be in the same Availability Zone
->General Purpose SSD (gp2 and gp3), Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1 and io2), Throughput Optimized HDD (st1), Cold HDD (sc1), and Magnetic (standard)

EBS Snapshot:
• Save point-in-time snapshots of your volumes to Amazon S3. Incremental backups of EBS volumes
• New volumes and instances can be created from snapshots. Region Specific. Can be shared across AWS accounts

Storage Gateway:
->set of hybrid cloud storage services that provide on-premises access to virtually unlimited cloud storage.
->Move backups to the cloud. Use on-premises file share backed up by cloud storage. Low latency access to data in AWS
->Types:File, Tape, Volume Gateway

AWS Backup:
->fully-managed service that makes it easy to centralize and automate data protection across AWS services, in the cloud, and on premises. 
->Using this service, you can configure backup policies and monitor activity for your AWS resources in one place.
