S3(Simple Storage Service):
->Amazon S3 is an object storage service that stores data as objects within buckets. 
->An object is a file and any metadata that describes the file. A bucket is a container for objects. Bucket name is globally unique
->Storage service to all kinds of data

Storage classes:
Amazon S3 offers a range of storage classes designed for different use cases
• Standard -> The default storage class
• Standard-IA -> Amazon S3 stores the object data redundantly across multiple geographically separated Availability Zones
• One Zone-IA -> Amazon S3 stores the object data in only one Availability Zone, which makes it less expensive than S3 Standard-IA
• Intelligent Tiering -> Amazon S3 storage class that's designed to optimize storage costs by automatically moving data to the 
most cost-effective access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead
• Glacier -> Use for archiving data that is rarely accessed and requires milliseconds retrieval
• Glacier Deep Archive -> Use for archiving data that rarely needs to be accessed. Default retrieval time of 12 hours

Storage management:
Amazon S3 has storage management features that you can use to manage costs, meet regulatory requirements, 
reduce latency, and save multiple distinct copies of your data for compliance requirements.
• S3 Lifecycle – Configure a lifecycle configuration to manage your objects and store them cost effectively throughout their lifecycle. 
You can transition objects to other S3 storage classes or expire objects that reach the end of their lifetimes.
• S3 Object Lock – Prevent Amazon S3 objects from being deleted or overwritten for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely. You can use Object Lock to help meet 
regulatory requirements that require write-once-read-many (WORM) storage or to simply add another layer of protection against object changes and deletions.
• S3 Replication – Replicate objects and their respective metadata and object tags to one or more destination buckets in the same or 
different AWS Regions for reduced latency, compliance, security, and other use cases.
• S3 Batch Operations – Manage billions of objects at scale with a single S3 API request or a few clicks in the Amazon S3 console. 
You can use Batch Operations to perform operations such as Copy, Invoke AWS Lambda function, and Restore on millions or billions of objects.

Bucket policy:
->A bucket policy is a resource-based AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy that you can use to grant access permissions to your bucket 
and the objects in it. Only the bucket owner can associate a policy with a bucket
->Common elements – Resources, Actions, Effect, Principal

EFS(Amazon Elastic File System):
->provides serverless, fully elastic file storage so that you can share file data without provisioning or managing storage capacity and performance
