Amazon VPC:
->Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) provides a logically isolated area of the AWS cloud where you can launch 
AWS resources in a virtual network that you define
->This virtual networking environment gives you full control and allows you to choose your own IP Address range, Subnets, 
Route Table configuration, Network gateways and much more
->A VPC is a private network in the AWS cloud, which is a regional resource. So, the scope of a VPC is within the AWS region in which it was created.
->VPC’s are associated with a Private CIDR range of either an IPv4 address or IPv6.
->VPC’s are divided into sub-networks or subnets, which spans across an Availability Zone in the region.
->Each subnet has its own CIDR IP range which is a subset of the VPC CIDR range.
->Instances are launched into any one of the subnets and are allocated a Private within the IP range of the subnet.
->VPC’s have a router and a route table attached to the subnets, which allows to control the flow of traffic based on the routing rules defined.
->Since VPC’s are private networks, to enable access to the Internet, an Internet Gateway is attached to the VPC.
->VPC’s have Network Access Control Lists or NACLs at the subnet level to control the Inbound and Outbound traffic to them

Route Table:
->When a VPC is created, a Route Table called as the Main Route Table gets created along with it.
->All the Subnets in a VPC are implicitly associated with this Main Route Table.
->The Route table comprises of a set of rules, called as routes that determine the flow of network traffic from your subnet. 
It is controlled by an Implicit VPC router.
->Custom Route Tables can also be created, and it can be associated with a subnet of choice. One Subnet can be associated with only a single Route Table

Internet Gateway:
->Internet Gateway is a VPC Component which is highly available, redundant and horizontally scalable.
->It allows communication between the VPC and the internet.
->It provides a target which can be added in the VPC route table for enabling internet-routable-traffic

If a subnet is associated with a route table that has a route to the internet via the Internet Gateway, then the subnet is known as a Public Subnet

Security Group(Default – All Inbound traffic blocked; all Outbound traffic allowed):
->Security Groups act like a virtual firewall for the EC2 Instances.
->When an EC2 Instance is launched within a subnet in a VPC, it is associated with a Security Group which is a virtual firewall.
->Security Groups, control the Inbound and Outbound traffic to and from the Instance.
->Security Groups, support only Allow rules, not deny rules.
->Security Groups are stateful, which means if a request is sent from an instance outbound, then the response traffic is allowed to flow back in regardless of the
inbound rules.
->One Security Group can be attached to multiple Instances.
->Security Groups are components of VPC, and they are specific to the VPC in which it was created

NACL:
->Network Access Control Lists or (NACLs) are optional security layer for the VPC, using which the Inbound and outbound traffic of subnets can be controlled.
->When a VPC is created, a NACL is created along with it called as the default NACL. All subnets within the VPC are implicitly associated with
this default NACL, unless explicitly associated with any other.
->The default NACL, allows all Inbound and Outbound traffic to and from the subnet.
->One subnet can be associated with only one NACL, but one NACL can be associated with multiple subnets.
->NACLs support both allow and deny rules.
->NACLs are stateless, which implies, that response to allowed inbound traffic is dependent on rules defined outbound and vice-versa. It
signifies that responses to inbound and outbound traffic must be explicitly allowed.
->Every NACL Rule has a number associated with it. NACL’s rules are evaluated based on the rule number assigned to them, starting with
the lowest rule number. Rules with lower number are applied, regardless of any other rule with a higher number contradicting it

comparison between NACLs and Security Groups:
->NACLs are resources applied at the subnet level, whereas security groups are applied at the instance level.
->NACLs supports both Allow and Deny action for rules, whereas Security Groups support only Allow rules.
->NACLs are stateless, whereas Security Groups are stateful.
->NACL rules are evaluated based on the rule number assigned to them, whereas in security groups, all rules are evaluated to allow a traffic.
->NACLs are implicitly applied to all instances in the subnet in which they are associated, whereas Security Groups must be explicitly attached to an Instance

NAT Gateway
->NAT Gateways are VPC components which allow, instances in the private subnet to communicate to the internet or other AWS services, but prevent the internet from
initiating an incoming connection with those instances.
->NAT Gateways are auto-scaled and support bandwidth from 5Gbps to 45Gbps. NAT Gateways support, TCP, UDP and ICMP protocols
->NAT Gateways are created in a public subnet. NAT Gateways have to be associated with an Elastic IP address
